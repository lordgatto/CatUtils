# CatUtils

### CatUtils is a utility plugin i originally made for my server, it relies on [NBT-api](https://github.com/tr7zw/Item-NBT-API) for NBT editing and is required, without it the plugin won't work, i am working to change it so if you don't use the special item utility you won't have to install this
